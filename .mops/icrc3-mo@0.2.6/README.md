# icrc3.mo

## Install

```
mops add icrc3-mo
```

## Usage

```motoko
import ICRC3 "mo:icrc3.mo";
```

## Initialization

This ICRC3 class uses a migration pattern as laid out in https://github.com/ZhenyaUsenko/motoko-migrations, but encapsulates the pattern in the Class+ pattern as described at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/writing-motoko-stable-libraries/21201 . As a result, when you insatiate the class you need to pass the stable memory state into the class:

```
stable var icrc3_migration_state = ICRC3.init(ICRC3.initialState() , #v0_1_0(#id), _args, init_msg.caller);

  let #v0_1_0(#data(icrc3_state_current)) = icrc3_migration_state;

  private var _icrc3 : ?ICRC3.ICRC3 = null;

  private func get_icrc3_environment() : ICRC3.Environment{
    ?{
      updated_certification = ?updated_certification;
      get_certificate_store = ?get_certificate_store;
    };
  };

  private func updated_certification(cert: Blob, lastIndex: Nat) : Bool{

    ct.setCertifiedData();
    return true;
  };

  func icrc3() : ICRC3.ICRC3 {
    switch(_icrc3){
      case(null){
        let initclass : ICRC3.ICRC3 = ICRC3.ICRC3(?icrc3_migration_state, Principal.fromActor(this), get_icrc3_environment());
        _icrc3 := ?initclass;
        initclass;
      };
      case(?val) val;
    };
  };

```

The above pattern will allow your class to call icrc3().XXXXX to easily access the stable state of your class and you will not have to worry about pre or post upgrade methods.

Init args:

```
  public type InitArgs = {
      maxActiveRecords : Nat; //allowed max active records on this canister
      settleToRecords : Nat; //number of records to settle to during the clean up process
      maxRecordsInArchiveInstance : Nat; //specify the max number of archive items to put on an archive instance
      maxArchivePages : Nat; //Max number of pages allowed on the archivserver
      archiveIndexType : SW.IndexType; //Index type to use for the memory of the archive
      maxRecordsToArchive : Nat; //Max number of archive items to archive in one round
      archiveCycles : Nat; //number of cycles to sent to a new archive canister;
      archiveControllers : ??[Principal]; //override the default controllers. The canister will always add itself to this group;
    };
```

For information on maxArchivePages and stable memory management, see https://github.com/skilesare/StableWriteOnly.mo. This configuration allows your archives to use up to 96GB(as of 12/5/2023) stable memory.

### Environment

The environment pattern lets you pass dynamic information about your environment to the class.

```
public type Environment = ?{
    updated_certification : ?((Blob, Nat) -> Bool); //called when a certification has been made
    get_certificate_store : ?(() -> CertTree.Store); //needed to pass certificate store to the class
  };
```

## Maintenance and Archival

Each time a transaction is added, the ledger checks to see if it has exceeded its max length. If it has, it sets a timer to run in the next round to run the archive. It will only attempt to archive a chunk at a time as configured and will set it self to run again if it was unable to reach its settled records.

When the first archive reaches its limit, the class will create a new archive canister and send it the number of configured cycles. It will fail silently if there are not enough cycles.

## Transaction Log Best Practices

This class supports an ICRC3 style, write only transaction log. It supports archiving to other canisters on the same subnet. Multi subnet archiving and archive splitting is not yet supported, but is planned for future versions.

Typically you want to keep a small number of transactions on your main canister with frequent and often archival of transactions to the archive. For example, the ICP ledger uses 2000 transactions as the max and 1000 as the settle to. If you utilize stable memory, you should be able to write a very large number of transactions to your archive. We do not yet have benchmarks and have yet to do max out testing, but we feel comfortable saying that 4GB or 62500 pages should be safe. You will need to determine for your self what the max number of records that can fit into the alloted pages is. If you have a variable or unbounded transaction type you may need to consider putting your max pages higher and number of transactions lower.

Future versions may make this more dynamic.

Future Todos:

- Archive Upgrades
- Multi-subnet archives
- Archive Splitting
- Automatic memory monitoring
